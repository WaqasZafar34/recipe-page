    <h1>Instructions</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
     You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
    <li>Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
    <li>Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
     the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
    <li>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
    middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
    <li>Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
    fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
    <li>  Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
    </li>
  </ol>
